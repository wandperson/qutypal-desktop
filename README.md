# Desktop-QutyPal
A cross-platform desktop companion built with Python and Qt

QutyPal is a fun and interactive desktop application inspired by the classic shimeji characters. Written in Python using the Qt framework, it brings cute, animated companions to your screen.
Watch them move around, interact with you, and bring life to your workspace!


I'm not a pixel artist, so I use free assets created by [Elthen](https://www.patreon.com/elthen) as a starting point.<br>
The base sprites for my character come from Elthen's [2D Pixel Art Fox Sprites](https://elthen.itch.io/2d-pixel-art-fox-sprites), which I then modify to suit my project.
